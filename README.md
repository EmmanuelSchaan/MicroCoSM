Microwave Components Sky Model implements the foreground model in Dunkley+13 https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0776
Shows the frequency dependence of the extragalactic foregrounds in temperature, in terms of intensity, temperature [Kcmb] and Rayleigh-Jeans temperature [Krj].
Shows the foreground power spectra for any pair of frequencies.

Just clone and run:
```
python driver_cmb.py
```
